## Overview

The task was to create a Resume page where I would list all of my information. And add a routing for practicing routing. And also getting familiar with Material UI

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- view the necssary informations.
- able to visit different route for different sections.

### Links

- [Github](https://github.com/zillur-rgb/resume-app)
- [Live Site](https://effortless-medovik-dc044c.netlify.app/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React JS
- Material UI
- Styled Components

### What I learned

I started this project only to get familiar with Material UI and also practicing routing. Material UI is kind of similar to Bootstrap. I still prefer Tailwind.

### Continued development

I could make a better responsive design which I will work later on.
